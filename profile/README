# Ethvault

We are building infrastructure related to deploying and executing transactions from cross-chain multisigs. 
In other words, yet another account abstraction smart contract wallet company. What sets us apart:

- Gas-optimized multisig EVM smart contracts, homed on Ethereum L1
- Free ENS resolution and record editing
- An API-based multisig transaction tracker and signer
- A legacy signer that allows your wallet to be recovered in case of catastrophe
- Transaction relaying and gas abstraction
- Gas refunds on batched transactions

Please get in touch if you are interested in working together!
